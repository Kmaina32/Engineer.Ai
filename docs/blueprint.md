- Status alerts: Alert system, indicating the status of components based on the analysis coming from the AI.

## Style Guidelines:

- Primary color: Dark blue (#2C3E50) to convey a sense of reliability, depth, and technical expertise; dark color schemes also aid readability in low-light industrial settings.
- Background color: Very dark blue (#1A232E), almost black.
- Accent color: Orange (#E67E22) to highlight actionable items, alerts, and critical data points; the use of orange provides a visual cue for immediate attention in a maintenance context.
- Body and headline font: 'Inter', a sans-serif typeface, for its clean, modern, and highly legible design, crucial for data-heavy interfaces.
- Use clear, simple icons that match the dark interface to represent equipment types and maintenance tasks.
- Dashboard-style layout with clear data segregation using cards and tables for immediate information assimilation.
- Subtle transitions and loading animations to enhance user experience without distracting from critical data.
